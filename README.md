# InetConnect
Alternative Inetkey software allowing intranet authentification through vpn 

The purpose is to select wich interface to use for connecting to the intranet while your are connected to your hyper secured vpn.
This is not a replacement of the Inetkey program from the Stellenbosch university only a tool to help you connecting to your vpn or other private connection and stay connected to the intranet.

This tool is in Java feel free to copy or modify it. Designed for the intranet of Stellenbosch university in South Africa during my abroad semester. 

Enjoy.
